In order to first initialize with the coding, the necessary software must be installed. Java JDK must be installed. NOTE: IT is important the user follow
these steps in order to guarantee successful instalation.


-Our choice of IDE is Android Studio, so I created a basic template from the link to see if everything is working correctly. Im pleased to inform you it is.


IE:
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestJunit {
   @Test
	
   public void testAdd() {
      String str = "Junit is working fine";
      assertEquals("Junit is working fine",str);
   }
}
