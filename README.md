# Comp330_Project2

Objective:
As you begin your mission, you are going to write requirements for the 5 improvements you plan to make. Unlike in Homework 1, youâ€™re going to spend the first few days writing a document explaining how you will create the dream (perfect) notetaking system, which will be better than Google Keep, Evernote, or OneNote (just to name a few). Your requirements document is to be created on Google Docs and will be linked to your Files and Docs section with commenting enabled. I suggest you create the empty document and start working on it right away.
