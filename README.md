# Comp330_Project2

Objective:
Write a document explaining how you will create the dream notetaking system, which will be better than Google Keep, Evernote, or OneNote (just to name a few). The requirements document is to be created on Google Docs and will be linked to your Files and Docs section with commenting enabled. I suggest you create the empty document and start working on it right away.
